# Custom Backpack Framework

This is an update to the Custom Backpack Framework mod originally created by
Aedenthorn. I have updated it to support Stardew Valley 1.6. It is
undergoing testing and likely still has some issues with the update.

The mod allows using Content Patcher to enable multiple additional backpack
slots. A companion mod exists to add up to 72 slots of inventory.
